As computer architecture is evolving very quickly, and the computing world is witnessing new trends and programming paradigm specially the use of Graphics Processors for General Purpose Computing. As GPUs have enormous power, a power which if harvested gives a normal PC capabilities of Super Computer, so the project is to implements a problem which requires enormous power for simulation. Here we have chose “The Game of Life” and "Fish and Shark" because its not only compute intensive but also best fits in the CUDA paradigm, for having many threads. The problem have not been implemented in a better way yet – which could utilise the GPU in an efficient way.
